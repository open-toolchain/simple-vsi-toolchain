# This step logs into the Virtual Server Instance based on the credentials provided during the Toolchain creation.
# The step: 
#   - Assumes that the upstream task has already downloaded the artifact to the /output location 
#   - Carries out all the operation within the home directory of the user i.e. /home/${HOST_USER_NAME}
#   - Copies the artifact from the /output to /home/${HOST_USER_NAME}/app which is defined as WORKDIR
#   - Runs the deploy.sh file as created in the previous step to carry out the step-by-step deployment which may include start/stop of application.
