template.name: "Develop a Java Application and Deploy to a Virtual Server (Virtual Machine)"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop and deploy an application securely into a Virtual Server Instance(VSI) managed by the IBM Cloud. By default, the toolchain uses a sample maven based Java \"Hello World\" app, but you can also bring your own maven based Java app and link to it instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with [Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/va?topic=va-va_index), [Code Risk Analyzer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd-configure-cra-repos), source control, issue tracking and online editing.\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-develop-kubernetes-app-toolchain)."
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new build pipeline, which will be scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed in your VSI instances. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://github.com/open-toolchain/simple-vsi-toolchain/blob/master/README.md) for this toolchain.\n Note: If you are using a COS instance for artifact storage then Artifactory is not used. It is safe to ignore the Artifactory tile and leave it unconfigured."
