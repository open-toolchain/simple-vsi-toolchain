# Develop a Simple Java Application and Deploy on Virtual Server (Virtual Machine)
### Continuously Deliver a Java Application to the Virtual Server Instance.

By following this tutorial, you can create an open toolchain, and then use the toolchain and DevOps practices to develop a simple "Hello World" Java web application that you deploy to the IBM CloudÂ® Virtual Server Instance.

This Simple Java application exposes an HTTP Endpoint at port 8080 of the host machine to present a Hello World Greeting message at the /v1/ HTTP Path. The application utilizes a maven build system to provide build and test capability. The application comes preconfigured for a DevOps toolchain that provides continuous delivery with source control, issue tracking, online editing, and deployment to the IBM Virtual Server Instance. 

The application code is stored in the application source control repository whereas the build and deploy scripts are stored in the pipeline source control repository. The build and deploy scripts can be customized to suit the development needs of the application.

The toolchain implements the following best practices:
- Builds application binary on every Git commit, sets a tag based on build number, timestamp, and commit id for traceability
- Inserts the built binary into the deployment manifest automatically.
- Creates IBM Cloud Storage Instance and Bucket to store the intermittent build binaries out-of-box. For advanced users, the IBM Cloud Storage Instances and Buckets to store binaries can be customized to utilize existing resources.
- For advanced users with versioning requirements for the build binaries, the toolchain supports TaaS based artifactory (for IBM account users) as artifact store. An existing artifactory repository can be configured and integrated with the toolchain to support the versioning of these build artifacts.

### Prerequisites:

- **Virtual Server Instance** - 
This toolchain requires a Virtual Server Instance running in IBM Cloud. If you don't have one, then you need to [create a Virtual Server Instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-virtual-servers) in IBM Cloud which serves as the target host where the Java Application should be deployed.   

    *   The Virtual Server Instances needs to have a Floating IP that is accessible over the public internet. More instructions on using a Floating IP with your instances can be found [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-console#reserving-a-floating-ip-address)

    * Please ensure that the Security Group assigned to the Virtual Server Instance Inbound rules allow access to a port, default is usually port 22 where the SSH service listens for the incoming SSH requests. More instructions on configuring Security Groups for a Virtual Server Instance can be found [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-groups?topic=security-groups-getting-started).

    * The toolchain needs the login credentials, preferably of a non-privileged user, to connect to the Virtual Server Instance to deploy and run the built application binaries. The toolchain supports credentials in the form of Username/Password or Username/SSH-Keys combination. Refer to [detailed instructions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-ssh-keys#ssh-keys) on how to create SSH keys for a given user account..

    * The toolchain performs health check of the deployed application. It is required to add a inbound rule for `TCP` allow port `8080` so that application endpoint can be accessed. More information can be found [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-groups?topic=security-groups-managing-sg)

Note: 
1. If you are providing SSH private key as credentials, convert the SSH key into `base64`, as explained later in this article. 
      
2. If you are providing Username and Password, enable `PasswordAuthentication` in the Virtual Server Instance. More information can be found [here](https://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/rhce-study-guide/how-to-configure-ssh-server-in-redhat-linux.html)

### Advanced User Scenarios:

Any change to the source triggers the CI Pipeline. The result of a successful CI Run is a new build/binary artifact which is stored first to an intermediate storage and then deployed to the target Virtual Server Instance. The toolchain provides user with an option to use either IBM Cloud Object Store or Artifactory as an intermediate storage to store the build binaries.

 - **Cloud Object Store (Default)** -  The toolchain leverages the IBM Cloud Store to archive intermediate application build binaries. In case user does not have an instance of IBM Cloud Object Store, the toolchain creates one on behalf of user. The toolchain then creates a bucket to store all the built application binaries. In cases when user intends to use an existing instance of IBM Cloud Store and Bucket, user can configure the toolchain to utilize the same. More instructions on creating an instance of Cloud Object Store can be found [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-provision)

 - **Artifactory (Optional)** - The toolchain provides the capability to utilize an existing instance of JFrog Artifactory as a storage for the build/binary artifacts (for ex. jar, exe).  This TaaS-based Artifactory instance is accessible only with valid IBM credentials. Refer to the TaaS Guide https://taas.cloud.ibm.com/guides#artifactory 
Please note: 
	 - If artifactory is configured and integrated then artifactory is used as intermediate build storage.
	 - If the COS bucket name is configured then corressponding bucket is used as intermediate build storage.
	 - If neither Artifatory nor COS bucket name is configured, then toolchain creates a COS instance in the default resource group. Once a COS Instance is successfully created, toolchain creates a bucket within the newly created COS Instance and use the same for storing artifacts.

### Additional Information
#### How to role back to one of previous version of deployed application?

1. if you want to revert your current version and install last version of the application then we can make use of inventory repo.

   1. `git clone <inventory-repo-url>` clone the inventory repo from your pipeline. This will download entire git repo. We will assume that CD-Pipeline is listening to master branch of the inventory repo.
   2. `git log` will provide you list of commits that has been done by CI pipeline.
   3. `git checkout master` will checkout to master branch.
   4. `lastCommitID=$(git log --format="%H" -n 1)` will get the last commit ID of the repo.
   5. `git revert $lastCommitID` will create a new commit by reverting the current change. Make sure that you provide a commit message for this revert.
   6. `git push` will push the change to inventory repo. This will initiate the CD-pipeline for application deployment.
2. if you want to role back your current version and install a previous version of the application then we can make use of inventory repo.
      
   1. `git clone <inventory-repo-url>` Clone the inventory repo from your pipeline. This will download entire git repo. We will assume that CD-Pipeline is listening to master branch of the inventory repo. 
   2. `git log` will provide you list of commits that has been done by CI pipeline. identify the `commit id` which you are targeting for the application deployment.
   3. `git reset --hard shaCommit .` will revert the changes in your working directory. 
   4. `git push origin master --force` will push the change to inventory repo. This will initiate the CD-pipeline for application deployment.

#### GitOps flow

This section walks through a workflow, Where a CD pipeline will be triggered only when a pull request/commit to a specific branch of inventory Repo takes place.

1. Create a Toolchain in IBM Cloud for VSI Instance by providing VSI instance, Application Repo, COS etc... details.
2. Once the toolchain is created, Click on the Inventory repo and create multiple branches(Prod, Staging and DEV).
3. Click on the CD Pipeline and go to triggers. Add a trigger with source as Inventory Repo with the branch which you want to trigger the CD-Pipeline(Master).
4. Now modify your CI pipeline to commit to respective inventory repo after successful integration.
5. Once there are sufficient number of commits are available in inventory repo. raise the pull request in inventory repo to master.
6. Now your CD Build be initiated.
